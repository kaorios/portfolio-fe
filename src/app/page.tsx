            These days, I focus on designing and architecting frontend code
            (also UI component libraries), building web applications using
            TypeScript, React, and Next.js(CSR, SSR) including unit tests, and
            building pleasant and effective teams.

          <h2>Clean Code for Frontend</h2>
          <p>
            Frontend engineers always white humble parts and business parts. To
            test what the company wants to do, write strong and easy-to-change
            code at heart. Bonus: the code would be easy to change even for
            those with little front-end knowledge.

          <h2>Architecture...?</h2>
          <p>
            I am learning the architectures. It will change depending on the
            size and division of the service, so I always want to come up with
            an architecture that I think is the best right now for each service.

          <h2>Philosophy</h2>
          <p>
            Release is always &quot;exciting&quot; for me. I continue to try to
            reduce the worry when releasing as much as possible. I want to
            strengthen our cooperation with automated testing and QA teams.

          <h2>Love Teams</h2>
          <p>
            One of the important things when working is a Team for me. I believe
            that{' '}
            <span className={styles.bold}>
              a good team can deliver a good product
            </span>
            . What is a good team?, It depends on the teammates. For me, polite
            vibes, keep learning and improving, and work-life balance. I just
            want to hear, &quot;what is a good team for you?&quot;.
